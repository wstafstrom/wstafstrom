- ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, Iâ€™m @wstafstrom
- I'm a PhD candidate at Cornell University in the section of Plant Breeding and Genetics.
- ðŸŒ± My research focuses on various methods of mitigating the effects of mycotoxins in the food system. 
- I primarily focus on the genetic architecture of maize resistance to mycotoxin-producing fungal pathogen like _Fusarium verticillioides_.
- Other projects include integrating remote and proximal sensing data to predict aflatoxin and fumonisin concentrations, and using a maize kernel sorting device to remove fumonisin-contaminated kernels.
